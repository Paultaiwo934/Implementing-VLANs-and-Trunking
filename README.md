<h1>Implementing Port Security</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves configuring and verifing port security on a switch. Port security restricts portâ€™s ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>CLI</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>CISCO Packet Tracer</b> 

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

- <b>Topology: <b/>

- <b>Enabled port security on F0/1 and F0/2 on the switch and set the maximum devices that can access the ports to one so only PC 1 and PC 2 in our topology can access these ports.
- Secure the ports so that the MAC address of a device is dynamically learned and added to the running configuration.
- Set the violation mode so that the F0/1 and F0/2 are not disabled when a violation occurs, but a notification of the security violation is generated, and packets from the unknown source are dropped.
- Disabled all the remaining unused ports:

Verify port security is enabled and the MAC addresses of PC1 and PC2 were added to the running configuration: <br/>

A Rogue laptop was connected to port F0/2, this was flagged as a violation as only PC2 is allowed to connect to F0/2. Therefore, the rogue laptop could not ping PC1:  <br/>
